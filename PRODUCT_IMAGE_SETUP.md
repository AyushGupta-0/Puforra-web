# Product Image Setup

## Important: Add Your Product Image

The website is configured to use a product image at:
```
/public/product-image.jpg
```

**To add your product image:**
1. Place your Puffora Naturals product image in the `/public` folder
2. Name it `product-image.jpg` (or update the path in the code)
3. The image will be used for all product cards and product detail pages

**Current image paths in code:**
- Product cards: `/product-image.jpg`
- Product detail page: `/product-image.jpg`

If you have separate images for each flavour, you can update the `products.js` file in `/src/data/products.js` to include individual image paths for each product.
